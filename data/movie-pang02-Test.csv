Neg, with his successful books and movies   michael crichton is doing well    with early successes with westworld   1973   and coma   1978     and recent films such as jurassic park   1993     his films have been entertaining    however   he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere    this $100 million mess by good director barry levison   disclosure   is dull   long winded   and a huge disappointment    considering the huge budget   the all star cast   and a story by crichton   sphere is majorly disappointing    the film opens with norman goodman   hoffman     a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors    however   when he arrives   he his told by supervisor barnes   peter coyote   that he is actually investigating an spacecraft    along with goodman is mathematician harry adams   jackson     biologist beth halperin   stone   and ted fielding   liev schrieber      they investigate the spaceship   find a massive sphere inside   meet an alien intelligence called jerry   and basically weird crap happens    unfortunately   something went wrong along the way with sphere    the film starts off entertaining enough   but throughout this very long movie   it just gets sillier and sillier    the film jaunts along from scene to scene   never fully explaining what is going on    the actors and directing don t help   either    hoffman is on autopilot   and almost seems embarrassed   throughout the movie   churning out dull lines   and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie    stone is useless   displaying no emotion   and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman    the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson   who s funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere    but he s hardly in it   and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone    the same goes for peter coyote   who hams it up as the officer   but is then killed off halfway through    the director   barry levinson   who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure   1994   messes up with the drama and the action    the drama scenes are   quite frankly   boring   and the action scenes suffer from overkill   with levison throwing the camera all over the place   much like the godawful speed 2   1997    the writing doesn t help much   either    although crichton is great with plots   he s terrible with dialogue   and practically every line in sphere is a dud    the speech is too simple   i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent    practically every line is just stating the obvious    none of it is smart    also   where the hell did the budget go    the sphere itself is impressive   and there s a few nice special effect shots   but where the $100 million went is anyone s guess    there s a giant squid attack in the picture   but not once does the audience see the squid   even though the film has a massive budget    i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid   and if handled correctly it probably would    but the whole scene is done badly   and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid    finally   the film has no idea what genre to be    levison can t handle his own plot    it leaps from hokey sci fi   to horror   and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller    and   of course   the film is very much like the abyss   1988     although in it s defense   crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released   and is far superior to this rubbish      it s not all that bad though    the plot is all right   there s a few jump scenes   although nothing very scary   and there s the occasionally interesting bit    but overall   sphere is a big waste of some fine talent   a lot of money   and a potentially good movie    not really worth seeing    overall rating= review by david wilcock
Neg, director luis mandoki s last film was the superb   serious 1994 drama   when a man loves a woman     but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture     message in a bottle     which is the worst type of romance   a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up    everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before   and much better   so there s an absence of suspense   and the film ultimately moves at such a very   very deliberate pace   as if it is trying to make great     meaningful   statements and plot developments   that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through       message in a bottle   begins with theresa osborne   robin wright penn     a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune   whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day    inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine   and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and   to her objection   finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper    soon   a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message   and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake   theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks   a boating town in north carolina   to find out the specifics of the message    of course   garrett turns out to be a handsome   rugged man around theresa s age and played by kevin costner    she is immediately charmed by him   but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there   and finds that catherine was garrett s late wife who died a few years earlier    do you think you know where this is headed    most likely you do   and i wouldn t call it giving away anything to say that by the picture s end   the movie has fallen into deep   artificial melodrama that i didn t buy for a second    if there are any positive things to say about   message in a bottle     it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman   as garrett s stubborn   but loving father   are far above par to be in such a wasteful     shaggy dog   love story   and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast   and paints chicago as an equally alluring city    meanwhile   costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less than stellar films that he has made recently    it seems that with such bad luck   he wouldn t want to make another movie set near water   but here he is again with one of the main   and most ridiculous   centerpieces set on a storm swept sea    the other actors are all   sadly   wasted   including illeana douglas   an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the   friend   roles   here playing penn s confidante and co worker at the tribune    the first half of   message in a bottle   plays like a hum drum   trite television movie for the lifetime channel   as theresa spends a great deal of time   getting to know   garrett   with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining    usually   i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships   but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt   written     and not as if people were really   talking      when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other   and are not particularly interesting themselves   you know immediately that you are in trouble    i swear that while watching   message in a bottle     i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater   heck   in actuality i m not even familiar to the novel this is based on   by nicholas sparks      always one step ahead of the characters   the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried and true hollywood melodrama   the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing    nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa s secret   and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after    this same exact problem occurred in last year s very   very similar   watch this   and you will realize just how similar i mean   meg ryan nicolas cage romantic drama     city of angels      although theresa is deeply touched by the   heartfelt   letter that she finds in the bottle   perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own   preferably before filming began    it should have read     memo to screenwriters   use you brain !    
Neg, i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago    i guess my memory really sucks    there is very   very little that is funny in caddyshack    the laughs are few   and far between   and what there are really aren t that great    caddyshack   as the name implies   more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club    michael o keefe plays said caddy    why they cast this unknown   fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me    the movie doesn t seem to have a real plot   just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera    the only real story   if you can call it that   was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper   bill murray   who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course    most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera    with painfully limited success    bill murray is slightly amusing in places   but fairly wasted    the biggest waste of all is chevy chase   who didn t even crack a smile on my face with his character s lame zen like approach to golfing    there are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight   but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie    i guess that s what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid    i m not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of   but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper    nothing about this movie works    it wouldn t have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasn t going to fly    most of the scenes just couldn t possibly be funny    it s as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world    i m sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny    in reality   they were painfully embarrassing to watch    there is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the   hot babe   of the movie walking by in her bikini    olive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl    everything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned    maybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny    but for the rest of us   stay the hell away from caddyshack    
Neg, tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse    the fugitive    not quite   this is the plot for double jeopardy   another fugitive copycat without the action   excitement   and good acting that the original had    there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good   this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall   clever huh    oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband   bruce greenwood   who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man    both movies are on video    make the wise choice and pick the fugitive    there are so many flaws in double jeopardy   it is laughable    while serving time in prison   libby parsons   judd   discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice    learning that her husband is still alive   she decides to serve her time in prison   find him   retrieve her son   and kill her husband if necessary    when the strict parole officer travis lehman   jones   stands in her way   libby decides to break the rules   who knows why     and continue her plan   despite the fact that if she gets caught   she s going back to jail    director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son    every other scene   we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture    in an action movie like this   valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something    all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend   i miss my son      nothing more   nothing less    dr   kimble of the fugitive didn t look at one picture of his dead wife   his primary concern was to save himself    libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough    ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this   they will be typecast for the rest of their careers   kind of like their doomed co star tommy lee jones    winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i do my job whether they are innocent or guilty roles    people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right    though i don t think he will win another oscar again    the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons    even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer   the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count    burglary   assault   grand theft auto are some of libby s slipups    the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you re innocent of the major crime    hopefully criminals won t use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent    that would just be plain stupid    
Neg, while i am not fond of any writer s use of cheap   easy puns   i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it   witness my review of  pecker  from a couple of issues ago      so here goes   the juvenile   college set black comedy  dead man on campus  is dead on arrival    strait laced med student josh   tom everett scott   who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout    s blemish free academic record breaks out into fs   thanks to the influence of his ever partying roommate   cooper   mark paul gosselaar     who introduces josh to the sex  and booze filled nights that come with university life    with the threat of losing an academic scholarship   josh   and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming   cooper     what are two good hearted slackers to do    easy  look for a loophole   which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student s   or students    roommate commits suicide   the surviving student   s   shall receive straight as    so instead of studying   josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there   move him into their dorm room   and drive him to suicide before the semester ends    director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white   working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder   take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper s diabolical plot    until then   the usual boring cliches of college life   booze   sex   more booze   fill the time   which is made to feel longer by  saved by the bell  alumnus gosselaar s sitcom bred mugging    that said   once cohn and company do build some comic momentum   they mishandle it    the introduction of the manic   psychotic cliff   lochlyn munro     a potential roommate for josh and cooper   brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates   paranoid nerd buckley   randy pearlstein   and british death rocker matt   corey page      one wishes that cliff would reappear   but   as they say   be careful what you wish for    not surprisingly   he does resurface   and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose   almost immediately   his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty    the same can be said about all of  dead man on campus     whatever morbid appeal the far fetched premise has quickly evaporates   and the self absorbed characters   especially cooper   pretty much grate from the get go     dead man  doesn t grow tiresome   it already  is  once the clever opening titles are through    as it slogs along to a cheesy   happy for all parties conclusion    dead man  lives up to its title and then some  not only does the movie grow even more tired and die   it still insists on going on        like a zombie    
Neg, boy   what a great movie ! !  keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together   the director of the fugitive   andrew davis   back again to give us another thriller   and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot    how could this not be a blockbuster    all die hard keanu reeves fans   read on    ol   much ado about nothing   plays eddie kasalivich   a machinist studying at the university of chicago    to help pay for the rent   he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university    by happy coincidence   he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics    this project holds great promise   taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in    a potential solution to the earth s energy problems without the pollution cost    surely nobody could have any problems with that    morgan freeman is paul shannon   the project s sponsor    he works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public    he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly    so he murders the project leader   blows up the project   great but short scene here   sort of like a mini id4 city devastation thing   and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hi tech hush hush location    unfortunately   our intrepid machinist and an english physicist   weisz   manage to get away and now follows a fugitive like chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script    this movie is just dying for a comparison with   the fugitive      both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesn t change much   i guess we can t really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere    the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones   chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward    credit to them   but we aren t really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters    where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy   eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves  character is never given the time to develop    it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences   which frankly   get quite boring after a while    harrison ford was   the man against the world      he was alone in a world where he didn t know who to trust and it came across real well    in chain reaction   keanu reeves isn t alone    now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia   vulnerability and confusion    we don t get this    we get him thinking he s still in speed   only now our sandra bullock has an english accent   probably doesn t drive a bus   and hardly contributes anything to the movie    the producers here probably thought     hey   what if keanu and rachel don t hit it off too well    let s rope in that morgan to help us out      well   keanu and rachel didn t hit it off well on the screen   and most unfortunately   morgan freeman doesn t help much either    the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder    it s not really his fault    once again   andrew davis just doesn t take the time to build his characters    someone must have convinced him that this time round   cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken    the flying inkpot rating system   * wait for the tv2 broadcast     * * a little creaky   but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good   bring a friend     * * * * amazing   potent stuff     * * * * * perfection    see it twice    
Neg, there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling   hapless straight man from the hysterical   naked gun   films   crack an immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he s committed himself to starring in since    the wavering movie spoofs   however   are less forgivable    to be fair     wrongfully accused     the send up in question and nielsen s third parody since the last   gun     isn t quite as excruciatingly humorless as his   dracula   dead and loving it   or   spy hard     which is a mighty good thing    nielsen is still in tip top comedic form   able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns   but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them   and he needs one very soon       wrongfully accused   meshes together the premises of   the fugitive   and   patriot games     casting its always game star as ryan harrison   get it       a master violinist who is drawn into an affair with a married temptress   kelly le brock      she   however   sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband   michael york     a crime actually committed by a one armed   one legged   one eyed man   aaron pearl      harrison is arrested   found guilty and sentenced to death   but escapes from a prison bus   of course   and then is pursued by a determined u   s   marshal named fergus falls   richard crenna   unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones  already smirky oscar winning role      there s also a mystery brunette   melinda mcgraw   and an assassination subplot involving the u   n   secretary general   but like any of it matters       wrongfully accused   gets off to an assured start   with an in concert nielsen   touted   lord of the violin   by bare chested posters   pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo clad mosh in front of the stage    nice touch    most of the scenes that follow   however   never top the opener       hysterical exceptions   the mentos and   baywatch   goofs      movie parodies are crammed in at an almost subliminal rate   but most are empty    when a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la   anaconda   or baseball players disappear into a   field of dreams    esque cornfield   there s really nothing to laugh at    other moments   like an interlude in a fishing shop   are so unfocused that you re not sure what you re supposed to be laughing at    there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send ups here   so it s possible that director/writer pat proft   by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two   guarantees something is sure to stick    and what does stick sticks well   particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hard boiled dialogue   what those   naked gun   s   which proft collaborated on   did great   these bits are so on target that they allow you to remember   wrongfully accused   as an almost halfway there spoof instead of a lame brained failure    the movie might have been cursed to begin with   opening fast on the heels of   mafia !     from proft colleague jim abrahams   and   baseketball     from proft colleague david zucker   but it s a strong possibility that nobody is going to be accusing   wrongfully accused   of being nielsen s funniest    
Neg, please don t mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam       i  just want to warn all of y all not to waste your hard earned $$$ on anaconda    it s not even worth a 99 cent video rental    don t listen to ebert on this one   he has no clue what he s talking about !    btw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was * required * to watch it on assignment   she reviews movies for a local paper      now i ll actually back up my huffing and puffing    here goes    movie   anaconda rydain s bottom line   wait for it to come on usa up all night    even then   i doubt it s worth the price of jolt   to help you stay up that late !    why do i hate anaconda    let me count the ways        first of all   this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong    as an ophiophile   snake lover     i can tell you that a   anacondas would never reach a length of 40 feet   b   they re scared of people   c   cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snake s mouth   and constrictor snakes don t kill what they can t eat   d   people can outrun snakes with no trouble   especially heavy ones like anacondas   e   if an anaconda did eat a human   it would need at least 6 months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal   therefore it couldn t run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast   and f   snakes have no vocal cords   so they can t make funny squealing noises    whew    i was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it    unfortunately   anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel    my friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end    anybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually    that was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didn t give up and fall asleep    he was the most likable character in the movie    who wouldn t enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman    anaconda did have its cute moments   arguments between ice cube s character and the british guy   for instance    however   those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twenty eight minutes of boring schlock    the writers had   and blew   a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines    i was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny    did she retort with a clever   ego withering comeback    of course not !     i m trying to work !    gee   that s even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with    she could have told him to go find a knothole or something           p but i will admit   there was just one scene where i was surprised at the outcome   hint   it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks      as for the plot   i m still trying to find one    this movie was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous   computer generated anacondas with the eyes and fangs of vipers and the faster than gravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet       harrier snake      not to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims    the writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist   should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense     in which the sick guy s g friend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him    that was about as clear and understandable as mission   impossible       if someone could explain that movie to me   i d be most grateful !  all the old guy double agents looked the same ! !    i wasn t inspired by the acting   save for the evil dude    i can t blame the actors   though    it s not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with    this concludes rydain s diatribe on a shameless exploitation   and perpetuation !   of public fear of snakes    comments   flames   anyone     rydain the atomic cheese   fresh from chernobyl dairies !  
Neg, this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be   one of the hottest writers in hollywood      he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream   8/10     then added the successful i know what you did last summer   7   5/10    script to his mix   and also created the popular tv series   dawson s creek      so when he asked to direct his first movie   based on his first ever script written   everyone and their grandma said   sure   go for it !      uhhm   my question is       did anyone bother reading this stupid script        plot   ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west   mrs   tingle   and set to lose her scholarship to college    when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story   they end up tying her up   and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman    critique   it s not so much that this is a bad movie   than the fact that it sucks    this movie is chock full of one dimensional characters   contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on   zero tension or thrills   plot holes the size of my big ass   lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie   and molly ringwald   vivica a   fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles    i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery   8/10   and 9 to 5   but unfortunately for williamson   he went nowhere with the bright foundation   making references to the exorcist and dr    zhivago   which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate    he also forgot about suspense   with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions   unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue    sure   katie holmes is cute   and her co star   marisa coughlan   did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist   worth two points out of my three on ten     but how can we forgive the biggest one dimensional character in any film   holmes  rival in the film   mrs   tingle s complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her   are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays     and a transparent romance between holmes and some long haired dude   hired to be the poor man s version of skeet ulrich   who himself is a poor man s version of johnny depp !      all in all   this movie was laughable for me   provided me with no insight into anything   demonstrated williamson s genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script   and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into   unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability   humanity or capacity to comprehend    no hip lines   no cheap thrills   just a dull time at the movie theater    if you want to see a funny teenage movie   go see detroit rock city   8/10     and thank my drunken   sorry ass in the morning    little known facts about this film and its stars   kevin williamson s father was a fisherman    kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer   7   5/10      he is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally   so is dawson leery on tv s   dawson s creek     a show kevin created    he was once an aspiring actor    in fact   he even landed a bit part on tv s   another world      also   williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs   tingle   which is also loosely based on the book   killing mr   griffin   by the writer of i know what you did last summer   7   5/10      lois duncan    he has also come out and said that he is a gay man    helen mirren was born in london   england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff    she is married to director taylor hackford   whose works include devil s advocate   8/10   and an officer and a gentleman   8   5/10      this film was originally titled killing mrs    tingle   but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident    actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called   wasteland      this is actor barry watson first full feature film    he has played the character of   seth   on tv s   malibu shores   several times    
Neg, in a typical cinematic high school   the football jocks have sex with the girls and then dump them   but not before the boys  scores are dutifully recorded in their little black books    as the sexual acts take place   the other guys hang out nearby   guzzling beer and grunting like pigs    in the rage   carrie 2   robert mandel s terminally bland sequel to carrie   there isn t a single original moment    only amy irving returns from carrie   and the talent of the rest of the sequel s cast is impossible to determine given the stupefying mediocrity of rafael moreu s script    as rachel   the horror story s lead   emily bergl gives one of the least scary performances in recent memory   but it isn t exactly her fault    the director asks for little from his actors   which is precisely what he gets    sporadically in this lame and lifeless movie   rachel will cause school lockers and windows to fly open   but generally she just mopes around looking like a victim    her fellow students delight in tormenting her    of course   she will get her revenge in the obligatory ending bloodbath in which she will decapitate and castrate the boys and crush the girls with burning timbers    as the movie marks time until its big finale   it throws in some repugnant scenes   hoping to turn audience s stomachs    rachel s girlfriend commits a horrible and realistic suicide after the boy who made   love   to her the night before spurns her       he gets major points in his black book for this   but his buddies say he would have gotten more if he had had sex with her after her death      even a helpless puppy is run over   and we see his poor   little body flipping over and over under a truck    the teenagers in the movie are completely blas   about it all       doesn t it offend you that some girl offed herself yesterday     asks one of the few kids with a conscience       why      responds his nonplussed girlfriend       she wasn t anybody      remarkably devoid of any energy   especially for a horror flick   the movie makes one yearn for a fast forward button on the theater s armrest    with material this bad   the film s only hope is to go for parody   but it isn t smart enough to realize it    even the mandatory epilogue is as pointless and predictable as the rest of the movie    the rage   carrie 2 runs 1   45    it is rated r for graphic violence   teen alcohol abuse   sex   nudity and profanity and would be acceptable only for older teenagers    
Neg, man   this was one wierd movie    similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn t decide which genre it is    the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone   which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship    the last half hour    this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided     screw it   let s just kill everybody      from then on   forget sci fi       this  movie becomes 100% horror    what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way    instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare   this movie just uses loud noises   sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore           yawn         everyone s  seen it all before and knows when to expect it    the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew    there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed   but what did this    then finally after being painfully restored   the new crew views the video    the acting isn t too bad at all           considering what the actors had to work with anyway   as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of    there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though   like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space    this movie could have been so much better    it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with    there was just nothing new here that any of us haven t seen before in aliens or hellraiser    
Neg, the king and i   a warner brothers animated   musical feature   recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king   with obvious results    when anna   miranda richardson     a british schoolteacher   travels to saim to educate the king s   martin vidnovic   children   she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly   and must say something to the greedy ruler    meanwhile   the king s prime minister   ian richardson     the stereotypical villain   plots to overthrow the king   taking the throne    the last   and most predictable   main subplot deals with the king s son   allen d   hong     and his love for a servant   tuptim   armi arabe     and how he conflicts with his feelings   and the ancient laws of saim    not even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent   as the king and i s problems could fill the blank pages of a journal    i will only note the major difficulties   for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail    the screenplay   written by arthur rankin   peter bakalian   jacqeline feather   and david seidler   which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein   has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory   as every time the obnoxious king would shout     etc   etc   etc     i would cringe    literally    speaking of cringing  i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film   which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking    besides the repetitive dialogue from the king   on the whole   the songs seem out of place   and unlike the lyrics   are unmagical    the sole song which is used cleverly is   getting to know you     which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors   which they have never been exposed to    unlike disney animated features   the king and i s songs don t add to the film   and are as uneffective as could be    take the following scenario as an example   as the sheer horror of the king and i s music is at its worst    you re being hunted by a dragon !  what do you do !    sing a happy song !  martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion  you hear the saying two negatives don t make a positive    believe it !  with the terrible dialogue that the king has   along with his awful voice track   the king is completely unbelievable   only shows mild signs of any personality   and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says   etc     etc     etc       more and more as the film progresses    no personality at the beginning of the movie   none at the end    and where does this character s personality change    hey   i thought anna was supposed to change him !  isn t that the whole plot    the prime minister s hideous sidekick   darrell hammond   brings his share of cringes as well   oh no !  another one of his teeth fell out !  hardy har har !  he is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets   but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him    by the way this review is going   you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films  hence why i hate this movie   because the king and i is a disgrace to animation    animated films   such as 1994 s the lion king and 1998 s the prince of egypt   are among my favorite movies of all time    the animation team does design their share of well animated settings   so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king   until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds    i have not read the play   or seen the oscar winning   1956 film adaption   but from what i can tell   the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play   for the king and i is never magical   nor interesting    if it wasn t for miranda richardson   who voices anna with feeling   the king and i could earn the title     worst movie of the decade      instead   the king and i will just go down as among the year s worst    the bottom line  avoid this movie at all costs    not even young children   the target audience in this film   will enjoy it    not the slightest bit    
Neg, synopsis   cro magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion    reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy style   ayla grows up to become a blond   feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate    comments   allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies    she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci fi classic blade runner    the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point   the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title    not even her starring role in this turkey   unfortunately   can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese    it s so uniquely bad   a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries   and miserably fails   to be serious   that it s oddly fascinating    the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed   wanting to see how this dud plays out    the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m   auel    to this day   the book possesses a loyal cult following    i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother    i have never read this book   but i sure hope it s 10   000 times better than its film adaptation    if not   then i m at a complete loss to explain its popularity    the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene    a young ayla   looking much like drew barrymore in e   t      tramps about in the woods    with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her   the audience s expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered    what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla s mother   a blonde with fur pants       er    leggings      tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera       well    as the earthquake slowly recedes    a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch   but the screaming six year old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven    i won t detail the story any further   this seems enough to illustrate my point    this movie is really stupid    it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief    also   the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston    the movie doesn t just suggest this message   it whacks the message into the audience with a two by four    a blond   gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs    she s of the   new people     they re of the   old people   with   the memories      yep    we get it    we get it    the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make up   which surprises me    the movie depends upon a lot of make up obviously   but much of it is unconvincing    as stated before   daryl hannah is daryl hannah here   she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time    the rest of the characters have dark make up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt    the face painting that s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind    this movie also suffers from its new age trappings    maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985   but now it sounds dated and cliched   like poorly conceived elevator music    add to this the film s faux mysticism   including spirit animals and dream visions   and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you d expect to hear on a 1 900 number   and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious    the clan of the cave bear is rated r   though it s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i ve seen in quite a while    it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity    the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes    the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear    the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about    although this may sound gratuitous   i m sure   it s so cheesy that it probably won t bother most people    the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie    however   as i wrote at the beginning of this review   it does have the distinction of originality    typically when i think of bottom of the barrel films dealing with early man   fantasy movies involving dinosaurs   who did not exist at the same time as man   and raquel welch come to mind    the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that   though it s so bad   the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie   which is why i awarded this turkey two stars      i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version   however   i m only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie    i shudder to think that it could be otherwise        
Neg, salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets    actors who demand such salaries might be greedy   but in some instances they are quite justified   because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation    proof for that can be found even in the realm of low budget movies   and one fine example is breakaway   1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring   in   famous figure skater tonya harding    face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie s poster   but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra   attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster    one day she decides to retire   but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that    realising that her life suddenly became worthless   myra starts running for her life   followed by professional assassins    terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater    although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities   her acting leaves much to be desired    on the other hand   her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality   believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b films a bad name    martin sheen s brother joe estevez   whose character looks like he had entered from another movies  set   is the only bright spot of breakaway    unfortunately   he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding s silver screen debut proved to be her last film    
Neg, movies like six days   seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford   anne heche   and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents      the script was written by michael browning   and he decided that   instead of thinking up new ideas   he d rehash a lot of cliches   omit even the slightest bit of character development   and then throw in drug dealing pirates to provide for a few high level action sequences and explosions      there are good scripts out there that high profile actors can make   see the truman show   for instance        six days   seven nights is simply a waste    let s see            we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island      so   how do we do that      well   we ll make her a feisty magazine editor   and we ll make him a crusty old pilot      but wait   she has to have a fianc   e   that can be david schwimmer      but wait   if she has a fianc   e   how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone      i know !    they ll get to their vacation spot   and then she ll get called back !    yessssss !    so   they ll crash on the island   and that will be funny for about five minutes      shucks    oh   i ve got it !    we ll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc   e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo   and then he can feel guilty      then   when anne heche kisses harrison ford   they have to kiss   because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie     it will be a vindicated action   because her fianc   e will already have cheated on her !    then   for no obvious reason   they ll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them      oh   yes !    i feel so good about this story      instead of using characterization to propel the events   it will be completely random   and yet totally predictable !    imagine that    don t get me wrong    six days   seven nights is not a boring picture   ford and heche both do a great job      the sparks fly between them   and so most of browning s inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors  sheer force of talent       almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen   and i found myself laughing pretty hard      schwimmer is also funny   and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get      and reitman   who has made some good films   at least tries to make things exciting      even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb   i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences    it s just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces      the picture feels like it s been hacked to pieces    i wouldn t be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely      the ones that are here are as bad as they come   i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships     and i d just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream     why did you pick this awful script !        the film is outright stupid   but some of the elements are subtly horrifying      for instance   take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo   and then feels really guilty      this is a serious problem in real life   but six days   seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device     his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford      in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety   i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story    this is summer movie season   but that doesn t mean our movies have to be dumb      1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters      when i was in line for six days   seven nights   i heard the woman in front of me ask for   two tickets to that new harrison ford movie         why didn t she know the name of the film      i suppose she just didn t care       what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big budget pictures don t realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves      good actors should sign to good scripts   and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash   they least they could do is assume that we d like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents    
Neg, if anything     stigmata   should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly themed films relatively close to one another    of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year   it is clearly the worst    i suppose i should have seen this coming    after all     blair witch   thoroughly creeped me out     sixth sense   was mildly spooky   and then   stir of echoes   had its moments   but wasn t anything i d lose sleep over    clearly   the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping    is it then any surprise that   stigmata   is the dullest   most horribly executed piece of mtv influenced tripe i have seen in a long while    no   not really    patricia arquette plays frankie page   a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe trotting mother    as it turns out   the rosary belonged to a recently deceased brazilian priest    the priest s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan   gabriel byrne   because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue    father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs   but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue    his investigation is soon called off   however   when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata   in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ    father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie  s story   considering she s an atheist   but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself   he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on    he eventually begins to suspect that his boss   cardinal houseman   jonathan pryce     is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church    as it turns out   the dead priest had been working on the translation of a   fifth gospel   before they were excommunicated    the new rupert wainwright music video            i mean film   stigmata   is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse    indeed   it would have been good if it were a music video   because it s only interesting for about five minutes    i m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow motion   double exposure   and extreme close ups   whoaaaaaa ! ! ! !     other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and   yes   he has been to film school    his camera trickery is interesting for a little while   but eventually   it becomes headache inducing    what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue   such as it is     with wainwright screaming at the audience     see    look at what i can do !  i m an ex cellent dir ect or      maybe then he d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow motion shots of water dripping in reverse   or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying   ooh   scary !      if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery   i didn t see it    just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story   here comes a double exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever    arrrrrrrghhhh            then again   the superfluous camera trickery wouldn t bother me if   stigmata   had a story or characters that were remotely engaging    though wainwright s vanity certainly doesn t help   he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script    where are plot continuity and character development when you need them    case in point   frankie page is the character that   i assume   we are supposed to identify and sympathize with   but we aren t given any back story on her character   or any reason to like her    the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard working hairdresser   who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building   and she s kind of cute   so let s start the bleeding !  the fact that she s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn t help   either    according to frankie page   what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back    go clubbing !  sure   that makes sense    arquette   byrne   and pryce give it the old college try   but their characters are so one dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking    scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat   because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable    even though frankie page s life is falling apart before her very eyes   she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon    even more curiously   he seems to be interested in her advances    father andrew s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic    as for pryce   he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle     i ll get you   my pretty     for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded    trust me   i m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain    what s worse   after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats   we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction   veers off in another   then another   and ends up being totally incomprehensible    first of all   the film doesn t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details   how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary    how come an atheist like her was chosen   since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata    actually   i m not sure what frankie was posessed by    supposedly   stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit   but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest   and later by some evil spirit   i think      which one is it    the answer to this question   of course   is very simple   the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr   wainwright wants to use this time    furthermore   the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap up   and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church    if you do any research at all about the gospel of st   thomas   you ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church   as the film seems to claim     but that it is readily available at your local library    there s nothing the catholics need to worry about   though       stigmata s   religion is so off base that it can t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church    if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters   they should have gone all out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns   which would have been far more interesting    i m not catholic   in fact   i don  t care much for the catholic church   but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means    it s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as   stigmata   does    it  s not thought provoking   though it would like to be   and it is definitely not scary   though it pretends to be    i m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film   because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story    maybe it s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever    the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over   and over   and over    like so many films of the mtv generation   this one suffers from overkill    so much is overdone in   stigmata     that it eventually has no effect on the audience   leaving us to pick out the film s   many   flaws    i m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st   thomas is so earth shattering    when we finally hear it   the saying sounds like something every five year old learns on their first day of sunday school   which means that for all its flash   the whole film is really much ado about nothing    the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog   and   stigmata   is it    
Neg, john boorman s   zardoz   is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own    not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d   wood jr   has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time    of course   wood s career can be explained by two things   he had no money and he had no talent    boorman   on the other hand   cannot court such excuses to explain   zardoz     or his follow up film   the equally awful   exorcist ii   the heretic        boorman obviously had a sizable budget   a matinee idol movie star   sean connery   in the lead role   and although you wouldn t know it from this film   boorman does indeed have talent    this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece   deliverance     1972     as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama   hope and glory     1987     the slightly over conceived arthurian epic   excalibur     1981   and the father son jungle adventure   the emerald forest     1985      his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination   but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste    if boorman is anything   he s ambitious   and when he succeeds   it s in grand fashion    unfortunately   the bigger they are   the harder they fall   and when boorman falls   the resounding impact can be heard for miles around       zardoz   is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies   an obsession of boorman s    his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even   the wizard of oz     a book which figures into the movie s plot    but   despite all this reaching   the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling    the events take place in the distant year 2293   but there is little of the typical futuristic movie ness to be found    in fact   things seems to have moved backwards   with people riding horses   shooting old style guns   and living in large victorian mansions    it s more middle ages than space age    the world of   zardoz   is divided into two distinct hemispheres   the outlands   where all the poor   pathetic people live   and the vortex   where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life    these immortals never grow old   they never engage in sexual activity   they possess psychological powers   and they live in a sort of quasi utopian marxist society where everyone is equal   and everyone contributes equally to the society    however   if one breaks the rules   that person is punished by being aged so many years    if someone breaks the rules enough   he or she is aged to the point of senility   and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals    one of the immortals   arthur frayn   niall buggy     a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face   is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed    like   the wizard of oz     he adopts a god like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head       this flying head is one of the movie s opening images   and it s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come      calling himself zardoz   frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators   whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can t procreate and take up more resources    from inside his giant   stone head   zardoz bellows seriously laugh inducting statements like     the gun is good    the penis is evil      that line alone is worth the movie s cult following    one day   an exterminator named zed   sean connery     sneaks into zardoz s flying stone   pushes frayn out   and goes back to the vortex    once there   the immortals label him a   brutal   and study him like a lab rat   taking great   perverse care in exploring his sexuality   which is a mystery to them    they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection   and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up    i say   hilarious   because that is exactly what   zardoz   is    it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so   he made this film with the straightest of faces   although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward   he didn t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming    just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles   he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper   a mane of hair braided halfway down his back   a wyatt earp style handlebar mustache   and a pair of thigh high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker    boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of   deliverance     which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green light this effort    he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera   including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth     2001       whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in   zardoz   besides the inadvertent humor    sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971   and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace    he got exactly that in   zardoz     and it s a wonder it didn t end his career    i m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements    is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life    is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing    or is it a social statement   something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates    karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary    come to think of it   maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip    people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy    
Neg, the kids in the hall are an acquired taste    it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer    maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies   they would grow into the big screen    my recommendation is that   unless you are a big fan of the kids   skip the film    as it is   their first  and most likely only  attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv    a big budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show    the kids go through the motions   but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so    and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics    brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression    in typical sketch comedy tradition   each actor plays several roles    doctor cooper   kevin mcdonald   and his team create the drug    then   under pressure from don roritor   mark mckinney     founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals   dr   cooper releases the drug into the marketplace    the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film    at about 90 minutes   brain candy still seems long    the best thing about sketch comedy  and the kids are no exception  is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs   then go on to another quick skit    but with the additional set up necessary in telling a longer   coherent story   the laughs just dont come fast enough    strangely   the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv    the movie makes several attempts at risqueness  mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters  but they seem almost forced   as if they have to live up to a pg rating    one of the best bits   though   does make use of thompsons naked buttocks   we see him charging into battle  going to have sex with some guys taking a shower    in the classic of this genre   monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail    the kids   unfortunately   are not up to the task    there are some amusing moments   to be sure   but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one    
Neg, there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director    of course   his best film was 1978 s masterpiece     halloween     but he also made 1980 s   the fog     and 1987 s underrated     prince of darkness      heck   he even made a good film in 1995   with   in the mouth of madness      but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992   with the terrible comedy     memoirs of an invisible man      somehow   carpenter has lost his touch   with junk like his failed 1995 remake of     village of the damned     to his uninspired 1996 sequel     escape from l   a     those movies   however   look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film     john carpenter s vampires      if i was him   i definately wouldn t want to put my own name in the title    it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as     vampires      the story is simple    jack crow   james woods   is a vampire hunter who   along with one of his partners   montoya   daniel baldwin     and a prostitute   katrina   sheryl lee     survives an attack from the master vampire   valek   thomas ian griffith      since katrina was previously bitten by him   crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later   and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her    it seems valek s mission is to steal a black   wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him    my question is   how many time have we seen this same story played out    well   the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made       john carpenter s vampires     sadly enough   is one of the most unscary horror films i ve ever seen    in fact   there isn t even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105 minute running time    the non stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed   without any interesting camera work   which is usually a trademark of carpenter s    and then we come to the screenplay   which   as far as i can tell   is nearly non existent    there is no story development   and there isn t even an attempt to flesh out the characters    james woods can be a good actor   but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of   pseudo    clever lines of dialogue    daniel baldwin has some potential   but his character comes off as being very dense    and sheryl lee   faring much better as laura palmer in   twin peaks       like all of the female characters   plays an offensive stereotypical whore    there is not an ounce of intelligence   or excitement in     john carpenter s vamires     which is very disheartening coming from an ex fan of carpenter s    he has said that he turned down directing     halloween   h20     because he couldn t work up any excitement for it    and yet   when asked about a   vampires   sequel   he said he would be happy to do it    i think that s a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent   not to mention a significant number of iq points    
Neg, two party guys bob their heads to haddaway s dance hit   what is love      while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub    it s barely enough to sustain a three minute  saturday night live  skit   but  snl  producer lorne michaels    clueless  creator amy heckerling   and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution s recurring   roxbury guys   sketch that would presumably make a good feature    emphasis on the word   presumably       a night at the roxbury  takes an already thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point  and that of viewers  patience levels    the first five minutes or so of  roxbury  play very much like one of the original   roxbury guys   skits    with   what is love      blaring on the soundtrack   the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi   chris kattan and will ferrell   bob their heads   scope out   hotties   at clubs   and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts    there is one crucial difference   however  these guys speak    that little fact has been used as justification for the film s existence   that the butabis  newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters    the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren   ferrell   and kattan are new   that s for sure   but they all lead to comic dead ends    there is no story per se   only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots    the brothers literally run into   or   rather   get run into   as in by car   richard grieco of  21 jump street  fame   and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club    there   they meet a hotshot club owner   chazz palminteri   conspicuously uncredited  can you blame him       who takes an interest in an idea of theirs    meanwhile   the bros  overbearing father   dan hedaya   wants them to stop clubbing    when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father   a rift is created between the two    the narrative messiness of  roxbury  would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny   but virtually none of it is    the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film   with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end    alas   the joke  a rather lazy takeoff on  jerry maguire   will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film    granted   a lot of people  have  seen  jerry maguire    but the fact that the film s best joke is completely dependent on one s familiarity with another film says a lot about  roxbury  s lack of inspiration    that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves    like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of  saturday night live      the roxbury guys   is a one joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context    after watching one of the   roxbury   skits on snl   this is what you come away with from the characters   they bob their heads to   what is love        bump unsuspecting women   and       that s all    after watching  a night at the roxbury    you ll be left with exactly the same    
Pos, films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success   whether they re about superheroes   batman   superman   spawn     or geared toward kids   casper   or the arthouse crowd   ghost world     but there s never really been a comic book like from hell before    for starters   it was created by alan moore   and eddie campbell     who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid  80s with a 12 part series called the watchmen    to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd    the book   or   graphic novel     if you will   is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes    in other words   don t dismiss this film because of its source    if you can get past the whole comic book thing   you might find another stumbling block in from hell s directors   albert and allen hughes    getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in   well   anything   but riddle me this   who better to direct a film that s set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society    the ghetto in question is   of course   whitechapel in 1888 london s east end    it s a filthy   sooty place where the whores   called   unfortunates     are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision    when the first stiff turns up   copper peter godley   robbie coltrane   the world is not enough   calls in inspector frederick abberline   johnny depp   blow   to crack the case    abberline   a widower   has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium    upon arriving in whitechapel   he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly   heather graham   say it isn t so   and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can t stomach    i don t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper   so i won t go into the particulars here   other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay    in the comic   they don t bother cloaking the identity of the ripper   but screenwriters terry hayes   vertical limit   and rafael yglesias   les mis   rables   do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end    it s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because   after all   an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts    and from hell s ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days     who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star          don t worry   it ll all make sense when you see it    now onto from hell s appearance   it s certainly dark and bleak enough   and it s surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did   at times   it seems like sleepy hollow 2      the print i saw wasn t completely finished   both color and music had not been finalized   so no comments about marilyn manson     but cinematographer peter deming   don t say a word   ably captures the dreariness of victorian era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks   even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black and white comic    oscar winner martin childs    shakespeare in love   production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place    even the acting in from hell is solid   with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent    ians holm   joe gould s secret   and richardson   102 dalmatians   log in great supporting roles   but the big surprise here is graham    i cringed the first time she opened her mouth   imagining her attempt at an irish accent   but it actually wasn t half bad    the film   however   is all good    2   00   r for strong violence/gore   sexuality   language and drug content
Pos, every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio   with every indication that it will be a stinker   and to everybody s surprise   perhaps even the studio   the film becomes a critical darling    mtv films   election   a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon   is a current example    did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened    the plot is deceptively simple    george washington carver high school is having student elections    tracy flick   reese witherspoon   is an over achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question   way   way   high    mr     m     matthew broderick     sick of the megalomaniac student   encourages paul   a popular but slow jock to run    and paul s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well   for personal reasons    the dark side of such sleeper success is that   because expectations were so low going in   the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be    you can t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews   which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have     election   a good film   does not live up to its hype    what makes  election  so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from  rushmore    released a few months earlier    the similarities are staggering    tracy flick    election    is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs   and is involved with the school play    max fischer    rushmore    is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs   and is involved with the school play    the most significant tension of  election  is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student    the most significant tension of  rushmore  is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student    tracy flick is from a single parent home   which has contributed to her drive    max fischer is from a single parent home   which has contributed to his drive    the male bumbling adult in  election    matthew broderick   pursues an extramarital affair   gets caught   and his whole life is ruined    he even gets a bee sting    the male bumbling adult in  rushmore    bill murray   pursues an extramarital affair   gets caught   and his whole life is ruined    he gets several bee stings    and so on    what happened    how is it that an individual screenplay    rushmore    and a novel    election    contain so many significant plot points   and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other   made from two different studios   from a genre   the high school geeks revenge movie   that hadn t been fully formed yet    even so   the strengths of  election  rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick   witherspoon   and newcomer jessica campbell   as paul s anti social sister   tammy    broderick here is playing the mr   rooney role from  ferris bueller    and he seems to be having the most fun he s had since then    witherspoon is a revelation    it s early in the year   it s a comedy   and teenagers have little clout   but for my money   witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination    and once campbell s character gets going   like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium   then you re won over    one thing that s been bothering me since i ve seen it    there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film    i suppose that   coming from mtv films   i should expect no less        but the film starts off light and airy   like a sitcom    as the screws tighten   and the tensions mount   alexander payne decides to add elements that   frankly   distract from the story    it is bad enough that mr   m doesn t like tracy s determination to win at all costs   but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship    even so   there s no logical reason why mr   m has an affair when he does    there s a lot to like in  election    but the plot similarities to  rushmore    and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex driven   mark this as a disappointment    
Pos, you ve got mail works alot better than it deserves to    in order to make the film a success   all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars   have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits    no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it s body   it s basically a complete re shoot of the shop around the corner   only adding a few modern twists      essentially   it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking    it s overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy   not to mention very manipulative    but oh   how enjoyable that manipulation is    but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does   because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming   sleepless in seattle    it couldn t have been the directing   because both films were helmed by the same woman    i haven t quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you ve got mail   but then again   is that really important    if you like something so much   why even question it    again   the storyline is as cliched as they come    tom hanks plays joe fox   the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley   the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family run children s book shop called   in a nice homage   the shop around the corner    fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business    little do they know   they are already in love with each other over the internet   only neither party knows the other person s true identity    the rest of the story isn t important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen    sure   there are some mildly interesting subplots   but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship    all of this   of course   leads up to the predictable climax    but as foreseeable as the ending is   it s so damn cute and well done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does    when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love   i was filled with such   for lack of a better word   happiness that for the first time all year   i actually left the theater smiling    
Pos,    jaws   is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen    the movie opens with blackness   and only distant   alien like underwater sounds    then it comes   the first ominous bars of composer john williams  now infamous score    dah dum    from there   director steven spielberg wastes no time   taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly    right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean   and once   jaws   has attacked   it never relinquishes its grip    perhaps what is most outstanding about   jaws   is how spielberg builds the movie    he works it like a theatrical production   with a first act and a second act    unlike so many modern filmmakers   he has a great deal of restraint   and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act    until then   he merely suggests its presence with creepy   subjective underwater shots and williams  music    he s building the tension bit by bit   so when it comes time for the climax   the shark s arrival is truly terrifying    he doesn t let us get bored with the imagery    the first act opens with police chief martin brody   roy scheider     a new york cop who has taken an easy   peaceful job running the police station on amity island   a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years    the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july   and the mayor   larry vaughn   murray hamilton     doesn t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money    brody is joined by matt hooper   richard dreyfuss     a young   ambitious shark expert from the marine institute    hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it    his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark     it s a perfect engine   an eating machine     make it that much more terrifying    when vaughn finally relents   hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint   robert shaw   on his decrepit boat   the orca   to search for the shark    the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark   and inevitably   are hunted by it       jaws   is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing   tension   and horror    it is like ten movies all rolled into one   and it s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975   taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time   until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by   star wars        even today   fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock s   psycho     and it never seems to age    although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences   including several mechanical sharks   obsolete   none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill    the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing   characterization   sharp editing   and creative photography   instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects    scheider   dreyfuss   and shaw were known actors at the time   jaws   was made   but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman    nevertheless   this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark    scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what s right and going against the entire town       it s your first summer here   you know     mayor vaughn warns him    dreyfuss   who had previously been seen in   american graffiti     1973   and   the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz     1974   gives a surprisingly mature   complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers    however   most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie s captain ahab   a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards    bordering of parody   shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism    he s slightly deranged   and shaw s performance is almost a caricature    however   there is one scene late in the film   when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars    quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u   s   s    indianapolis   a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese    his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1   000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair raising than anything spielberg put on screen    shaw delivers the story in one long take   and it is the best acting in the film    of course   we can t leave out the shark itself   with its black eyes   endless rows of teeth   and insatiable urge to eat   it is basically the epitome of all mankind s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature    a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real    having survived sinch the dinosaurs   great whites do exist   they can be as large as the shark in   jaws     and they are a threat    every one of spielberg s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark   a bunch of writihing   dangling   completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into    the shark in   jaws   was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks   all nicknamed   bruce   by the crew   built to be shot from different angles    many have forgotten   but   jaws   was a sort of precursor to   waterworld     1995     a movie s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb    but   as we can see now   spielberg overcame all the obstacles   and delivered one of the finest primal scare thrillers ever to come out of hollywood    
Pos, moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post salary cap era    you ve got to know how to allocate your resources    every dollar spent on a free agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers    in the nfl   this leads to teams like the detroit lions   who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract   but can only field five guys named herb to block for him    in the movies   you end up with films like   spawn     with a huge special effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors    jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking    he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line    watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid   fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars   is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit   except that sanders doesn t have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages    but like the lions star   jackie doesn t have anybody to block for him    almost every cent that s invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts   and as chan does his own stunts   the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills    this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors   chan directs     scripts and dubbing and supporting characters   not to mention the hideous title sequence    this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain       chan s first release in this country     rumble in the bronx     was supposedly set in new york   but was filmed in vancouver   and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible      heck   jackie doesn t even have enough money for a haircut   looks like   much less a personal hairstylist    in condor   chan plays the same character he s always played   himself   a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen   a master of both kung fu and slapstick fu    jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert   and is chased by a horde of neo nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs   one of the things i like about jackie chan movies   no political correctness      he is joined by three women   who have little to do except scream     jackie   save us !     and misuse firearms    the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere   and he s more pathetic than evil    en route   we have an extended motorcycle chase scene   a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo nazis   and two confrontations with savage natives    once at the secret desert base   there is a long chop socky sequence   followed by the film s centerpiece   a wind tunnel fight that s even better than the one in face/off    this is where the money was spent   on well choreographed kung fu sequences   on giant kevlar hamster balls   on smashed up crates of bananas   and on scorpions    ignore the gaping holes in the plot   how   exactly   if the villain s legs were broken   did he escape from the secret nazi base   and why didn t he take the key with him        don t worry about the production values   or what   exactly   the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara    just go see the movie    operation condor has pretentions of being a   raiders of the lost ark   knockoff   but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him    with a lawrence kazdan screenplay   a john williams score   spielberg directing and george lucas producing   condor might be an a+ movie    however   you ve got to go with what you ve got   and what you ve got in jackie chan is something special    a talent that mainstream hollywood should   could   and ought to utilize    
Pos, on june 30   1960   a self taught   idealistic   yet pragmatic   young man became   at age 36   the first head of government of a newly independent african state   formerly the belgian congo    two months later   he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides    this little known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in   lumumba      patrice lumumba s   eriq ebouaney   story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary     lumumba   death of a prophet     virtually guaranteeing that his new   fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject    peck   with co writer pascal bonitzer   begins at the end of the story of the young political leader    we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men    images of hatchets   saws and fast emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image    jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian owned congo    a third class postal worker   lumumba   speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes   proclaiming himself not tribal   not regional   but a national leader    his small   mobile party   the congolese national movement   mnc   is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer   and get his face known   in the bustling capital   stanleyville    at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world   lumumba is in the right place at the right time and   through political savvy and chess like manipulation   achieves a position of leadership of the mnc    as the date for independence approaches   he tactically positions himself to be the new nation s first prime minister and defense minister   supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu   maka kotto      the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country s vast natural resources of copper   diamonds   gold and more    lumumba won t seek the help of the us   knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government    his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination    the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies   the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves   belgian troops violently intervene   the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe   pascal nzonzi   and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad    this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries    peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba   his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50 s and 60 s       during the time the story takes place   many new nations   including nigeria and somalia   were born   with varying degrees of success and failure   usually dependent upon which country colonized them    some colonial masters were better than others      the effort involved in   lumumba   is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades   if at all    production values are first rate on what must be a small   by us standards   budget    the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique    the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba s life    the political side of things is evenly told in a linear   straightforward manner that teaches   not preaches    it concentrates on the good deeds of the man   if a bit as a stalwart saint   but doesn t embellish on a larger than life persona    the family side of patrice s life is handled in several   perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children   embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child    i know the intent is to flesh the man out   but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba    the story   as such   has a lopsided feel about it    high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character    the actor gives a convincing   charismatic performance as the multifaceted   politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions    in true docudrama tradition   the supporting cast does not outshine the star   complementing his good efforts   instead       lumumba   is a solid   interesting   educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos   both    it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i ve seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+    
Pos, apparently   director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film   american history x   i don t know the details of the fight   but it seems that he is not happy with the final product   and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether    i ve heard about this kind of thing happening before   and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce    as it is   i found american history x to be an extremely good film   not just because of tony kaye s focused look at the touchy subject of racism   but because of a powerful   charismatic performance from edward norton    it s hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton s fantastic role in primal fear   but   here he is now   starring in his own film and making himself a star    norton is one of those performers who becomes his character   and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year    he plays a young man named derek vinyard   a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother   danny   edward furlong     mother   beverly d angelo     and sister   davin   jennifer lien      the film opens with a flashback   in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car    we find out that this lands him in prison   and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny    in the present time of the film   danny is in high school   and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother    much of the film is told in flashback   and we see the path that leads to derek s adoption of white supremacy    when derek is released   having served three years in prison   he finds that his brother is now a full blown skinhead   derek   however   has given up the violence   and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things    what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid   thoughtless people    they are intelligent and articulate   and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms    it s hard to make a controversial movie and not preach   but kaye has found the right note for his material    because american history x is a mainstream film   there has to be a redemption phase for our main character    some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic    i partially disagree with this   because   although i do not advocate racism in any way   it s interesting the way kaye presents derek    he is a loud   obnoxious man   but he s also very smart    the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable    his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men    it s clear that he s passionate about his beliefs   and that he s not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up    of course   it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part    it s astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest    in addition to getting the look just right   he s perfect for this role    derek requires intelligence   depth   and a whole lot of shouting   and norton does it all with ease    even when he s at his meanest   derek has a likable quality to him   and that s a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead    what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny s school   avery brooks   becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny    the other performances are all terrific   with standouts from furlong   d angelo   and lien    visually   the film is very powerful    kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices   and most of them work nicely    lots of slow motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere    but   like a lot of movies lately   american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes    although the climactic scene is very moving   the picture ends with a pretentious   preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed    for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point   it felt like a slap in the face to be hand fed a theme in such a simplistic way    it makes me wonder what   exactly   tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film    perhaps this last scene was the problem    it s hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good    in a time when so many movies are timid and weak   american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way    
Pos, one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy s wedding    and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it    her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald   who hasn t made a worthwhile film since 1986    but the fact is   betsy s wedding is also an alan alda film    and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years   alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects   including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life    written and directed by alda   betsy s wedding is a vibrant slice of life   mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor    alda s comic elixir is smooth and refreshing  and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare    as bride and groom   molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film   but they are by far the least interesting    walsh is a nonentity   with all the screen presence of a door knob    ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain    she looks hideous with her short cropped orange hair   red lip stick and grotesque outfits    she s supposed to be a dress designer   but she looks more like a clown    and to make matters worse   ringwald s performance matches her appearance    thankfully   alda keeps ringwald s screen time to a minimum   he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters    the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride s working class   italian family and the groom s rich   gentile family    ringwald s folks are homey and down to earth   with alda as her free spirited father   madeline kahn as her practical mother   and ally sheedy as her lonely sister    walsh s clan   on the other hand   is prim   proper and ostentatious    when the two families meet and mingle   the movie becomes a story of culture clash   or as one character puts it     money versus values      ally sheedy   in a wonderfully understated performance   is one of the film s most pleasant surprises    sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body    it s anthony lapaglia   however   who seizes the spotlight    lapaglia plays stevie dee   a suave   overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old fashioned chivalry    lapaglia s sincere but dim witted character is a riot    and what s uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro   with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure    lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting   and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role model and partly a rip off    i don t know whether to say a star is born or a star is re born   but i do know that lapaglia s over the top performance should not be missed    the scrumptious comic acting   however   extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia    joe pesci   in particular   sinks his teeth into his role as alda s unscrupulous brother in law   a slum lord with mob ties   who is cheating on his wife   catherine o hara      alda   faced with challenge of both directing and acting   somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride s financially strapped father   a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet    the film adopts alda s psychological point of view as he tries to one   plan the wedding   and two   pay for it    as a filmmaker   alda s style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful    and while he doesn t have the comic genius of a woody allen   alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy

Pos, after watching   rat race   last week   i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that   when not laughing aloud   i had held a grin for virtually all of the film s 112 minutes    saturday night   i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn t enjoy it as much the second time as the first       rat race   is a great goofy delight   a dandy mix of energetic performances   inspired sight gags and flat out silliness    hands down   this is the most fun film of the summer    the movie begins with zippy retro style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a  60s slapstick comedy   featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky jerky bodies bounding around the screen    then comes the setup    donald sinclair   john cleese     the

intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally   with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay off    had i been part of the filmmaking team   i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby s clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron    it would have drawn the same laugh without the

Pos, i ve noticed something lately that i ve never thought of before    pseudo  substance   hollywood faking deep meanings in their films    have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed   then when you look back   you realize there was something missing    more and more   filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed   melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film   but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience   you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff    i m not trying to say city of angels is that bad    it had a lot going for it   but somewhere along the way   it faltered    somehow   underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all   there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography    the predictable ending that shattered our hopes   even though we saw it coming   only added to the disappointment    but for over an hour   city of angels is well worth the time    nicolas cage is seth   a guardian angel who   like hundreds   likely thousands or even millions   of other angels   spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality   humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life    meg ryan   in her most subdued performance yet   plays maggie   a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive    after losing a patient on the surgery table   these questions envelope maggie   and seth   the angel who was there to oversee the patient s transition into the afterlife   is immediately captivated by the doctor    he begins following and observing maggie   falling more and more in love with her everyday    angels   who we quickly learn are not and never were humans   can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch   but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire    seth s adoration is too much to resist   and eventually he does appear to maggie   quite regularly   although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community    the angels are interestingly presented   all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities   but it s a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness    cage is a wonderfully versatile actor   think face/off   raising arizona   and it could happen to you   what a combo !   who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once    it s nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire    the two aren t very comparable to each other   but they both deviate from her usual   intelligently ditzy   romantic comedy roles   and it s an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy    but even though the two leads do an impressive job   it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye    it s a shame that with so much going for it   city of angels falters so much in its final stages   leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there   they just didn t know quite how to get to it    they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high    filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on   remember   and convey to others thru word of mouth   so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece   they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths    based on the german film wings of desire   that being the english title   of course     city of angels is ninety percent success   enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings   even the devastatingly disappointing ending    most movie goers   the non cynics anyway   will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized    nonetheless   city of angels is beautifully captivating   which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories

Pos, the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do    lives are often at stake   and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable   prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment s notice    the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor   psychologist   and sham artist   in addition to being a police officer   he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence   or failing that   must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower    most of all   the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible   and quickly gain control of the situation   dominate the conversation   and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants    it takes a pretty smart person to do that    but what if the hostage holding criminal is just as smart    what if he s also able to think on his feet    in fact   what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor    it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f   gary gray s the negotiator    in this film   police negotiator danny roman   samuel l   jackson   is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force    when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman s home   roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder    faced with the scorn of most of the police department   and under close scrutiny by the media   roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain s office    i don t quite remember if the captain actually said     i hate to do this   but            although it wouldn t surprise me if he did    luckily   the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above    after being offered a take it or leave it deal by the district attorney   roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum   j   t    walsh     taking him and others hostage   and proclaiming he has been framed    although roman s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build up   gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian   kevin spacey   which soon ensue    jackson   while a superb actor   is miscast in the role of roman    the actor has become so popular   and so often identified as a protagonist   notable exceptions can be found   such as in jackie brown     that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats    the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence    how can we believe he s going to shoot a hostage   no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier    unfortunately   this preconception saps the film of some of it s would be suspenseful moments   and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson s acting ability    almost every time he s in a scene   jackson steals it without looking back    when spacey appears   the film has already run about a third of its course    his is an interesting character    made out to be some kind of negotiating superman   our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation       i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower   but i can t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone     he says    when he gets the call to action   however   he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be    soon   his character has to negotiate not only with roman   but also with the swat commander   david morse   who is itching to send in a team to take roman out   all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation   should negotiations fail    this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor    as the second protagonist   spacey measures up nicely    gray really lucked out with this cast    david morse as commander beck   ron rifkin as commander frost   and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent   and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey    the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices   morse played a similar role in the rock   rifkin played the d   a    in l   a   confidential   and spencer played a police detective in cop land    with the level of acting   however   this can be forgiven    also in the supporting cast   paul giamatti as rudy   one of the hostages   is notable for the comic relief he provides    his character is initially so slimy   and giamatti himself just looks so shifty   that you expect to laugh before he even says anything    fortunately   this doesn t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film   but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout    j   t   walsh   as the suspicious internal affairs inspector   clocks in with one of his final performances    sadly   the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year   and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film    walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam   backdraft   and nixon    for one of his best performances   check out sling blade   in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton    when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march   walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success   the actors performed together in a few good men      the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh   and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role   it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing    in the end   the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it s reality    we re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best    as an audience   we re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie   and we d like to see if one will dominate the film    both provide some pretty good entertainment    
Pos, plot   a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon   to whom he s devoted a tribute band in which he sings   gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place    critique   i m a sucker for movies like this    a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams   works hard   devotes the time   the energy and the patience   and ultimately hits it big time    in the case of this film   our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it   yup   luck always finds its way into these types of equations   although generally tied very closely to hard work     they need a new singer    his entry and adaptation to the whole   rock  n roll   lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch    although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love   or past love   of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it    metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn t that prominent anymore   i still check out my motley crue   twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again    that s not to say that you won t like this film if you don t like the music   but the music and live performances from the band   play a big part in the movie   and i for one   had a blast watching and listening to it all    but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg    wow   hand this fella some major props   as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god   incidentally   metal god was the film s original title   and a much better one if you ask me      he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through    he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic   who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams    aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend   and the romance angle between them was sweet     but she didn t pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes    i was also impressed by some of the   real   musicians who played in the film   zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne   jeff pilson from dokken   stephan jenkins from third eye blind   blas elias from slaughter     but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members    it s to note that this film was based on a real life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer   their original singer also admitted to being gay   as in this film      just for the record   i m certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements   since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies   but because it s a fun   uplifting   well paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances    oh yeah   and for those who dig the   heavier   side of music   the soundtrack also rocks ! !  you see       dreams  can come true        where s joblo coming from    almost famous   8/10     blow   8/10     boogie nights   9/10     detroit rock city   8/10     girlfight   6/10     goodfellas   10/10    
Pos, carry on matron is the last great carry on film in my opinion    made in 1972   it still features most of the regulars of this genre    sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit   kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting   head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac   hattie jacques re takes her role as matron   and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr   goode    the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs   with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard    this time   williams is after matron   jacques   when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr   goode    the doctor   hawtrey   is sworn to secrecy       i assure you   that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other !    bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself    there are great cameos from joan sims   an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene   and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he s at work   at the railway station      sid james  gang including cyril his son   kenneth cope   try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home    he has to share a room with nurse ball   barbara windsor   and she soon sees through him !  the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital s pills with panic ensuing    there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron   however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous  matron s     williams is   as usual   on top form   but sid james isn t given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all    the same does not go for charles hawtrey   for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time   he seems to steal every scene he is in    by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor s talent to full effect   the film seems to flounder   but it certainly makes up for it with it s good storyline and it s other appealing characters    this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored !  
Pos, the ultimate match up between good and evil     the untouchables   is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry    based on the 1959 television show of the same title     the untouchables   may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place   but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences   some excellent acting   a memorable score   and a clever script    the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public    elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order    however   as ness soon learns   in order to stabilize peace   you have to bend a few laws    the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes    the film begins with capone   played perfectly by deniro   declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws    the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl    from this point we know capone is evil   not only because he kills without hesitation   but also because he is a lying bastard    right from the first five minutes of the film   de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs    this developed hatred is before the film s hero   ness   is even introduced    i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone    the film only gets better from this point    with the formation of the untouchables   there is a group of men wearing long   dark overcoats and hats    they walk in unison and they only look forward    as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens    holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals   this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films    one that comes to mind is   the matrix   when neo   morpheus   trinity   and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world    wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930 s style   the similarities between these two are countless       the untouchables   has some of the hippest   bravest heroes in any action film    the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone s army    each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others    elliot ness   played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner   is a character that surely grows during the course of the film    he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be    however   as the film develops so does ness    his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side    he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends    his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in    sean connery   who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role   plays malone   an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables    malone acts as a mentor to ness    he teaches him   the chicago way   to do things   when they attack with a knife   you attack with a gun    connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed    andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone   a young man who is just becoming a police officer    as ness grows   he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him    charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone    smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film    the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen    also very similar to   the matrix     they are exciting and intense    >from a western like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps   the scenes are well thought out and well executed    the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement    its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors    the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective    although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified   this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting   great directing   and great action    some scenes   capone and the baseball bat   the train station   have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid    
Pos, having not seen     who framed roger rabbit   in over 10 years   and not remembering much besides that i liked it then   i decided to rent it recently    watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is    aside from the fact that it s a milestone in animation in movies   it s the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters   have them interact   and make it convincingly real   and a great entertainment it s also quite an effective comedy/mystery    while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original   especially baby herman   and watching them together is a lot of fun    the story begins in hollywood in 1947    cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work   so hard boiled private detective eddie valiant   bob hoskins   is called in by studio head r   k    maroon   alan tilvern   to try to help get roger s mind back on work    maroon thinks that roger s wife   jessica s   possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots    valiant takes some photos of jessica playing   `patty cake  with marvin acme   stubby kaye     the owner of toontown   where all of the cartoon characters live   and takes them to maroon    upon seeing them   roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect    the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town   and eventually toontown   trying to clear roger s good name    along the way they meet judge doom   christopher lloyd   a judge jury and executioner type who s out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon      `who framed roger rabbit  won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters   williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in      director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production   which included hundreds of animators    also bob hoskins  performance should be credited    he   in addition to the rest of the human cast   finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co stars    according to the internet movie database   hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off    `who framed roger rabbit  is a rare film    one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family   although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom      do yourself a favor and rent it   `p p p p please
