Nearly every student at Iowa State takes classes in the English department.
Whatever your major, the communication, technological, and creative thinking skills
we teach will add value to your life and to your resume. Our foundation classes are among the most innovative in the country. They cover not only writing skills, but oral, visual and electronic communication.

Our faculty consistently win awards for their great teaching, and our students do, too.
For example, Sarah Brown Wessling, the National Teacher of the Year in 2010,
earned her B.A. and M.A. in English from Iowa State.

Our degree programs offer both undergraduate and graduate students broad opportunities to research and study such fields as creative writing, linguistics,
literature, English education, communication and rhetoric.
